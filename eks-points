1. download eksctl command and run the below command to create eks cluster.
   eksctl.exe create cluster --name test-k8s --version 1.17 --ssh-access --ssh-public-key=jj --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name linux-node --node-type t2.micro --nodes 2
   a. if you want to connect to worker nodes, you need to mention public key in the command
   b. by default ekscli command will consider id_rsa.pub key to ssh to worker nodes.
   c. explicitly need to mention to have ssh access, otherwise the default value it consider is false
2. with config file also we can able to create cluster
   eksctl create cluster --config-file=create-cluster.json
3. to get config file which is defualt file considered by eksctl command, to get default config file run below command
   eksctl create cluster --name development --managed --dry-run
   eksctl create cluster --name development --dry-run
4. eks cluster created with 2 public and 2 private subnets
5. eks cluster gets created by cloud formation template in the backend.
6. 4 security groups get created, 
    a. control plane sg - these rules allows to make api reuqest to cluster
    b. node group sg - unmanaged and managed node to communicate
    c. shared control plane and node group sg - control plane and node group nodes to communicate
    b. cluster sg - 
 7. ekscli save eks config file under ./kube/config of user home directory, which allows to run kubectl commands
 8.
